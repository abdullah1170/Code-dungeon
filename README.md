#  Health-Care Web-App


Welcome to my Portfolio. Feel free to view, comment or download my code. 
This project is a model website gives overall heath guidance to the patient. 

It is a web –based application featuring almost all the features which a Health-care institute would have on their website.  This project provides services to the customers by delivering the basic services for the health care on their fingertips. The customers can access many features including Online Appointments booking and Video Appointments with Options to pay their medical bills online. 

The Online Pharmacy Store provides our customers to buy, refill their prescription’s drugs here, and also shop the vast lists of the other dispensary needs, all at on place.  

This project provides full access regarding the admin for creating/updating/deleting records of the patients. Also, scheduling appointments would be accessible by the patients if they wish to schedule them online.  

The Costumers would be assigned a UID and password to access their records. By logging in, they would be able to manage their appointments and other required reports from the hospital. 

The technologies mostly used are JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Ajax and PHP in the creation of this website.
